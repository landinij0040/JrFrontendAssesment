Excercise 1:
For Excercise 1 I made a simple staff page using mainly
div elements to organize the page. I used flex box to align
all the staffing cards. I used spans to style the information
in the staffing cards.


Excercise 2:
For Excercise 2 I made a simple moving slide using vanilla JavaScript 
and css. I used css to style images and the font to be on top of the image.
I used JavaScript to change the slide. I used gimp to help make the picture 
assets look better so the images do not look squashed when the css changes
the dimensions of the image.

Excercise 3:
For Excercise 3 I made a simple nav with the required constraints. 
I used Jquery to make the drop down show the required information 
when clicked on and not show the required information when hovered off.
I used css to style the nav bar and turn the nav items a different color 
when hovered over.
